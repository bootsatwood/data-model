# V18.0 → V18.1 Changes Summary
## Minor Database Corrections

**Date**: November 21, 2025  
**Version**: 18.1 (Minor fix from 18.0)  
**Type**: Database corrections per Rulebook compliance and business input  
**Status**: Ready for scenario regeneration

---

## Changes Applied

### Change 1: "unknown" Corporate Name Correction (121 facilities)

**Issue**: 121 facilities had `Corporate_Name = "unknown"` and were classified as Corporate

**Rule Violated**: Rulebook Section 2.3, Rule 1
```
IF Corporate_Name IS NULL OR Corporate_Name = ''
  THEN Ownership_Type = "Independent"
```

**Correction Applied**:
- `Corporate_Name`: "unknown" → "" (blank)
- `Ownership_Type`: "Corporate" → "Independent"

**Impact**:
- Corporate facilities: 12,053 → 11,932 (-121)
- Independent facilities: 8,970 → 9,091 (+121)
- "unknown" removed from Top Corporate Rankings

**Geographic Distribution**:
- PA: 45 facilities
- NC: 17 facilities
- VA: 16 facilities
- OH: 11 facilities
- SC: 10 facilities
- TN: 10 facilities
- IN: 7 facilities
- KY: 5 facilities

---

### Change 2: SABER Barrier Removal (159 facilities)

**Issue**: SABER HEALTHCARE GROUP had "Competitor Contract" barrier on all 159 facilities

**Data Source**: Phone call with Brooke - November 21, 2025

**Authorization**: Brooke confirmed SABER does not have active competitor barrier and should show as addressable opportunity

**Correction Applied**:
- Removed `Barrier = "Competitor Contract"` from all 159 SABER facilities
- `Barrier`: "Competitor Contract" → NULL (no barrier)

**Impact**:
- Total barriers: 1,383 → 1,224 (-159)
- SABER now eligible for Top Corporate Rankings
- SABER potential revenue changes from $0 to addressable

**SABER Facility Distribution**:
- VA: 47 facilities
- NC: 42 facilities
- PA: 36 facilities
- OH: 29 facilities
- IN: 3 facilities
- KY: 1 facility
- DE: 1 facility

**Expected SABER Ranking Impact**:
- 159 facilities (large corporate entity)
- Mix of existing markets (122 facilities in IN/KY/NC/OH/VA)
- Will likely appear in Top 10-20 corporate rankings after regeneration

## Overall Database Impact

| Metric | V18.0 | V18.1 | Change |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Total Facilities | 21,023 | 21,023 | 0 |
| Corporate Facilities | 12,053 | 11,932 | -121 |
| Independent Facilities | 8,970 | 9,091 | +121 |
| Total Barriers | 1,383 | 1,224 | -159 |
| Corporate Chains | 1,026 | 1,025 | -1* |

*One less "corporate" entity (SABER Healthcare Group still exists as corporate entity, but "unknown" pseudo-entity removed)

## Files Modified

**Sheet 5 - State Analysis:**
- Minor redistribution of revenue from Corporate to Independent
- Overall state totals unchanged

---

## Additional Deliverable

### Barrier & Contract Status Report

**New one-time report created**: `Barrier_and_Contract_Status_Report_V18.1.xlsx`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive view of all facilities with barriers or at-risk contract status

**Contents (5 sheets)**:

1. **Summary**: Overview of 1,224 barriers + 54 contract issues
2. **Facilities with Barriers**: Complete list of 1,224 facilities
3. **Corporate Barrier Summary**: Barriers grouped by corporate entity
4. **Red Contract Status**: 14 facilities with critical contract issues
5. **Yellow Contract Status**: 40 facilities with at-risk contracts

**Barrier Breakdown (V18.1)**:
- Own Provider Group: 402 facilities
- Alliance: 281 facilities
- Competitor Contract: 23 facilities (was 182, reduced by 159 SABER)
- MH Only Opportunity: 145 facilities
- Competitor Agreement: 115 facilities
- Alliance, Own Provider Group: 113 facilities
- Reputation: 97 facilities
- Termination Risk: 29 facilities
- Alliance, MH Only Opportunity: 19 facilities

**Contract Status Breakdown**:
- Green (Healthy): 20,969 facilities (99.7%)
- Yellow (At Risk): 40 facilities (0.2%)
- Red (Critical): 14 facilities (0.1%)

**Overlap**:
- 8 facilities have BOTH barrier AND Red contract status
- 5 facilities have BOTH barrier AND Yellow contract status

---

## Contract_Status Revenue Impact - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Question for Business/Technical Review**:

Does `Contract_Status` (Red/Yellow) block potential revenue the same way `Barrier` does?

**Current Understanding**:
- **Barriers** (per Rulebook Section 5.3): Explicitly block Integration & New Business revenue → $0
- **Contract_Status**: Field exists in database but NOT documented in revenue calculation rules

**Options**:
1. **If YES** (Red/Yellow blocks revenue): Update Economic Model scenarios to treat Red/Yellow like barriers
2. **If NO** (Red/Yellow doesn't block revenue): Red/Yellow is informational only, no revenue blocking
3. **Partial** (only Red blocks, Yellow is warning): Different treatment by status

**Recommendation**: Clarify business rule and update Rulebook Section 4 if Contract_Status affects revenue calculations.

## Questions for Resolution

1. **Contract_Status Revenue Impact**: Does Red/Yellow block revenue like barriers?
2. **SABER Census Data**: Verify SABER census data is current and accurate
3. **Unknown Facilities**: Should we research actual corporate parents for the 121 facilities now classified as Independent?
4. **Barrier Review**: Should we audit other Book1.xlsx barriers for accuracy?
