- **New Business**: 119 facilities, 10,222 beds
- **Total Available**: 12,080 beds
- **Revenue Opportunity**: $49.7M

### TIER 2: EDGE EXPANSION STRATEGY
**Target**: 7,000 beds in TN and PA  
**Strategy**: Adjacent states with elderly populations  
**Challenge**: NOT in our current 6-state analysis

#### What This Means:
- **Tennessee**: Requires new geographic analysis
  - Adjacent to KY (where we have 69 facilities)
  - Natural expansion from Louisville/Lexington metros
  - Need to map Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville metros
  
- **Pennsylvania**: Requires new geographic analysis
  - Adjacent to OH (where we have 148 facilities)
  - Natural expansion from Cleveland/Youngstown
  - Need to map Pittsburgh, Erie metros

**RECOMMENDATION**: 
1. First maximize OH/KY border facilities (Tier B Highway Corridors)
2. Then expand analysis to include TN/PA metros
3. Use same filtering methodology (Tier A = 15-mile radius)

### TIER 3: WHALE/CORPORATE M&A STRATEGY
**Target**: 2,500 beds via major corporate win  
**Strategy**: Win headquarters or regional chain  
**Our Analysis Shows Perfect In-Market Targets**:

#### Top Corporate M&A Opportunities (Already in Tier A)

| Corporation | Facilities | Beds | States | Revenue Potential |
|-------------|------------|------|--------|------------------|
| **American Senior Communities** | 17 | 1,674 | IN | $7.2M |

**VERDICT**: Any top 3 corporate win achieves 50-65% of target
- These are ALREADY in our Tier A metro analysis
- No need to expand to GA (unless specific opportunity)
- Focus on IN/OH based headquarters
