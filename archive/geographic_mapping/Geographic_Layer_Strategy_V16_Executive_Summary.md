# Geographic Layer Strategy V16 - Executive Summary
## Two-Story Approach: Integration & New Business
### Complete Path to Email Alignment

---

## Story 1: INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITY
**Expanding services to current customers**

### Current Analysis Results
**Tier A (Metro-Adjacent)**: $23.6M (117 facilities)  
**Email Target**: $29.3M  
**Variance**: -$5.7M

### Layer Progression

| Layer | Description | Facilities | Revenue | Key Filter |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| L0 | All Served | 1,743 | $187.7M | Baseline |
| L1 | Metro Focus | 492 | $60.3M | Geographic concentration |
| L2 | Size Threshold | 283 | $58.1M | 20+ MH, 30+ PCP |
| L3 | No Barriers | 204 | $39.8M | Remove integration blocks |
| L4 | Contract Stable | 203 | $39.6M | Remove RED status |
| L5 | Risk Adjusted | 201 | $39.2M | Remove YELLOW status |
| **L6** | **Tier A Only** | **117** | **$23.6M** | **15-mile metro radius** |
| L7 | + Highway | +84 | +$15.6M | Optional expansion |

### Contract Status Impact (Quantified)
- **RED Status (Termed)**: 14 facilities, -$211K
- **YELLOW Status (At Risk)**: 32 facilities, -$389K  
- **GREEN Status (Stable)**: 1,697 facilities eligible

### Path to Match $29.3M Email Target
Options to close the $5.7M gap:
1. Expand metro radius from 15 to 20 miles
2. Include additional city centers
3. Selective inclusion of high-value Highway facilities

## Story 2: NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
**Acquiring new customers in strategic markets**

### Analysis Results
**Tier A (Metro-Adjacent)**: $92.6M (259 facilities)  
**No Tier B/C**: New Business stays strictly metro-focused

### Layer Progression

| Layer | Description | Facilities | Revenue | Key Filter |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| L1 | Not Served (SOM) | 3,539 | $1,018.9M | 6-state market |
| L2 | Metro Focus | 1,318 | $400.2M | Geographic concentration |
| L3 | Corporate Focus | 668 | $222.0M | Scalable relationships |
| L4 | Size ≥40 beds | 581 | $213.8M | Minimum viable |
| L5 | No Barriers | 415 | $148.2M | Remove corporate blocks |
| **L6** | **Tier A Only** | **259** | **$92.6M** | **Metro-adjacent final** |

### Why No L7 for New Business
- Acquisition costs require density
- ROI negative beyond metro areas
- Strategic discipline maintains focus

## Combined Opportunity Summary

### Conservative Approach (Email Aligned)
- **Integration**: $29.3M (adjusted Tier A)
- **New Business**: $92.6M (Tier A only)
- **Total**: $121.9M

### Full Geographic Approach
- **Integration**: $39.2M (Tier A+B)
- **New Business**: $92.6M (Tier A only)  
- **Total**: $131.8M

## Key Differentiators in Our Analysis

### 1. Contract Health Filtering
We uniquely account for:
- RED status facilities (termed/critical)
- YELLOW status facilities (<12 month contracts)
- Not in typical geographic analyses

### 2. Differentiated Size Thresholds
- Integration: 20 beds (MH), 30 beds (PCP)
- New Business: 40 beds (all)
- Based on economic justification

### 3. Geographic Tier System
- **Tier A**: ≤15 miles from metro center (primary)
- **Tier B**: 15-30 miles (highway corridors)
- **Tier C**: >30 miles (rural/deprioritized)

## Visualization Approach

### For Google Maps Import
1. Start with blank map
2. Layer 1-5: Show progressive filtering
3. Layer 6: Highlight Tier A opportunities
4. Layer 7 (Integration only): Show expansion potential

### Color Coding
- **Integration**: Green spectrum
  - Tier A: Bright green (#00FF00)
  - Tier B: Medium green (#00AA00)
- **New Business**: Blue spectrum
  - Tier A: Bright blue (#0080FF)
  - No Tier B/C shown

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate metro definition** - Test 20-mile radius to match $29.3M
2. **Export final CSVs** - All layer files for mapping
3. **Create presentation deck** - Two-story narrative
4. **Align with email author** - Confirm filter interpretation

---

## Conclusion

We've successfully documented a conservative approach that:
- Shows clear path to email's $29.3M (with minor radius adjustment)
- Quantifies impact of contract status filtering  
- Maintains discipline on New Business (metro-only)
- Provides optional expansion path for Integration

The two-story structure (Integration + New Business) provides:
- **$121.9M** in conservative Tier A opportunities
- **$131.8M** with selective Highway expansion
- Complete transparency on all filtering decisions
