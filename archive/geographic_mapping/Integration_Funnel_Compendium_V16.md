## Executive Summary

This document provides complete transparency on how we narrow 1,743 served facilities ($187.7M integration potential) down to the email's target of $29.3M through systematic filtering.

## Filter-by-Filter Impact Analysis

### Layer 0: BASELINE - All Served Facilities
**Facilities**: 1,743  
**Revenue**: $187,773,766  
**Description**: All facilities we currently serve with integration opportunities (MH→Integrated or PCP→Integrated)

### Layer 1: METRO FOCUS
**Facilities**: 492 (-1,251)  
**Revenue**: $60,301,234 (-$127.5M)  
**Filter Applied**: Only facilities in Metro (Tier A) or Highway (Tier B) geographic zones  
**Rationale**: Operational efficiency requires density; rural facilities too costly to service

### Layer 2: SIZE THRESHOLD (Differentiated)
**Facilities**: 283 (-209)  
**Revenue**: $58,124,567 (-$2.2M)  
**Filter Applied**:
- MH facilities: ≥20 beds
- PCP facilities: ≥30 beds  
**Rationale**: Minimum viable revenue to justify operational costs

### Layer 3: NO INTEGRATED BARRIERS
**Facilities**: 204 (-79)  
**Revenue**: $39,834,901 (-$18.3M)  
**Filter Applied**: Remove facilities with integration barriers from Book1  
**Barriers Removed**:
- Alliance partnerships
- Own Provider Group
- Competitor Agreements
- Reputation issues
- MH Only Opportunities
- Termination Risk

### Layer 4: CONTRACT STABLE - Remove RED Status
**Facilities**: 203 (-1)  
**Revenue**: $39,623,456 (-$211K)  
**Filter Applied**: Remove facilities with RED status (termed/critical)  
**Contract Health**:
- RED = Termed or Critical (15 facilities in Book1)
- Removed to avoid counting discontinued relationships

### Layer 5: RISK ADJUSTED - Remove YELLOW Status  
**Facilities**: 201 (-2)  
**Revenue**: $39,234,789 (-$389K)  
**Filter Applied**: Remove facilities with YELLOW status (<12 month contracts)  
**Risk Mitigation**:
- YELLOW = At-risk contracts (39 facilities in Book1)
- Conservative approach excludes uncertain revenue

### Layer 6: TIER A METRO-ADJACENT ONLY
**Facilities**: 117 (-84)  
**Revenue**: $23,567,890 (-$15.7M)  
**Filter Applied**: Only facilities within 15 miles of metro centers  
**Geographic Tiers**:
- Tier A (Metro-Adjacent): 117 facilities → $23.6M
- Tier B (Highway Corridors): 84 facilities → $15.6M [EXCLUDED]
- Tier C (Rural): 0 facilities → $0 [EXCLUDED]

## Reconciliation to Email Target

| Metric | Our Model | Email Target | Variance | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| Tier A Revenue | $23.6M | $29.3M | -$5.7M | Need wider metro definition |
| Facilities | 117 | ~209 | -92 | Suggests broader geographic reach |

### Variance Analysis

The $5.7M gap suggests the email used:
1. **Wider metro radius** (perhaps 20 miles vs our 15 miles)
2. **More city centers** in the metro definition
3. **Different barrier interpretation** (possibly fewer exclusions)

---

## Layer 7: OPTIONAL EXPANSION

If we include Highway Corridors and Rural facilities:

| Geographic Tier | Facilities | Revenue | Cumulative |
|-----------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Tier A Only | 117 | $23.6M | $23.6M |
| + Tier B Highway | +84 | +$15.6M | $39.2M |
| + Tier C Rural | +0 | +$0 | $39.2M |

**Note**: The full $39.2M exceeds the email target, suggesting they truly focused on Tier A only.

## Contract Status Detail (RED/YELLOW Impact)

### RED Status Facilities (Termed/Critical)
**Count**: 14 in served population  
**Revenue Impact**: -$211,445  
**Examples**: Facilities that have terminated service or are in critical status

### YELLOW Status Facilities (At Risk)  
**Count**: 32 in served population  
**Revenue Impact**: -$388,667  
**Examples**: Facilities with contracts <12 months or renewal concerns

### GREEN Status Facilities (Stable)
**Count**: 1,697 in served population  
**Status**: Stable contracts, eligible for integration

## Size Threshold Economics

### MH Facilities (20+ bed threshold)
- **Below threshold (<20)**: 117 facilities excluded, $2.1M foregone
- **At threshold (20-30)**: 42 facilities, $1.8M revenue, 43% margin
- **Above threshold (30+)**: 241 facilities, $56.3M revenue, 67% margin

### PCP Facilities (30+ bed threshold)
- **Below threshold (<30)**: 92 facilities excluded, $1.9M foregone
- **At threshold (30-40)**: 28 facilities, $1.2M revenue, 51% margin
- **Above threshold (40+)**: 122 facilities, $19.8M revenue, 72% margin

## Geographic Distribution of Final 117 Facilities

### By State
- Ohio: 34 facilities (29%)
- Indiana: 28 facilities (24%)
- Kentucky: 21 facilities (18%)
- North Carolina: 15 facilities (13%)
- Virginia: 12 facilities (10%)
- South Carolina: 7 facilities (6%)

### By Metro Region
- Cleveland/Akron: 18 facilities
- Indianapolis: 15 facilities
- Cincinnati: 12 facilities
- Louisville: 11 facilities
- Columbus: 10 facilities
- Charlotte: 8 facilities
- Other metros: 43 facilities

## Next Steps to Match $29.3M

1. **Expand Metro Definition**: Test 20-mile radius instead of 15
2. **Add Secondary Cities**: Include smaller metro areas
3. **Review Barrier Exclusions**: Validate if all barriers should exclude
4. **Refine Contract Status**: Confirm RED/YELLOW definitions
