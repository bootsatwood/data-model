## PART 2: EXECUTIVE PRESENTATION NARRATIVE

### Opening Statement
*[All layers off - blank map]*

"Let me show you how we've identified **$528 million** in reachable healthcare facility opportunities across our six-state footprint."

---

### STORY 1: INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITY
**"First, let's look at expanding services to our current customers"**

#### Layer 1: Starting Point
*[Click: Show Layer 1 - Green pins appear]*

"We currently serve **1,743 facilities** across six states. These green pins represent **$127 million** in potential integration revenue - adding services to facilities where we already have relationships."

*[Pause for scale to sink in]*

#### Layer 2: Geographic Focus
*[Click: Layer 2 - Non-metro pins fade to 30% opacity]*

"But not all opportunities are equal. When we focus on our **19 strategic metro regions** *[pins brighten in metros]*, we see **1,247 facilities** representing **$98 million** - that's 77% of our integration opportunity concentrated in areas where we have operational density."

*[Zoom to Indianapolis to show cluster]*

"Look at Indianapolis - see how these facilities cluster? That's operational efficiency."

#### Layer 3: Ownership Priority
*[Click: Layer 3 - Blues separate from oranges]*

"Now let's separate corporate chains *[blue highlights]* from independents *[orange highlights]*. These **891 corporate facilities** represent **$71 million**. Why does this matter? One contract with Trilogy gives us 42 facilities. One contract with an independent gives us... one facility."

#### Layer 4: Size Matters
*[Click: Layer 4 - Small facilities fade to 10% opacity]*

"We've learned that facilities under 30 beds rarely justify our operational costs. Removing them *[small pins nearly disappear]* leaves us **743 facilities** and **$65 million** in viable opportunities."

#### Layer 5: Remove Barriers
*[Click: Layer 5 - X markers appear then disappear with facilities]*

"Now here's critical intelligence - we've identified **786 facilities with integration barriers** - contractual or competitive blocks. Removing these *[facilities with X disappear]* leaves **623 true opportunities** worth **$54 million**."

#### Layer 6: The Operational Reality
*[Click: Layer 6 - Three-color heat map appears]*

"Here's our breakthrough insight. After all filters, we classify by operational reach:"

- *[Bright green glows]* "**480 facilities in metro-adjacent areas** - our teams can reach these efficiently. That's **$41.2 million**."

- *[Yellow highlights]* "**117 facilities along highway corridors** - reachable but require planning. Another **$10.8 million**."

- *[Red dims]* "**26 rural facilities** - we'll serve these only if exceptional. Just **$2.3 million**."

"**The integration verdict: $41.2 million in immediately actionable opportunities.**"

---

### STORY 2: NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITION
**"Now let's look at new customer acquisition"**

#### Reset and Reframe
*[Click: Clear map, then show Layer 1 - Gray pins]*

"Shifting to growth mode. These gray pins represent **4,701 facilities** in our serviceable market that we don't currently serve - a massive **$1.2 billion** opportunity."

#### Layer 2: Geographic Focus
*[Click: Layer 2 - Metro regions highlight in purple]*

"Again, focusing on our metros *[purple brightens]* captures **3,854 facilities** worth **$1.1 billion**. The density is even more critical for new business - we need clusters to justify sales investment."

#### Layer 3: Corporate Priority
*[Click: Layer 3 - Blues separate prominently]*

"For new business, corporate chains *[blue intensifies]* are even more crucial. These **2,976 corporate facilities** worth **$893 million** offer scalable growth - win the parent company, get multiple facilities."

#### Layer 4: Size Threshold (Higher Bar)
*[Click: Layer 4 - Facilities under 40 beds fade]*

"New business needs scale. We set a 40-bed minimum *[small facilities disappear]* because setup costs require larger revenue. This leaves **2,234 facilities** worth **$751 million**."

#### Layer 5: Remove Barriers
*[Click: Layer 5 - More X markers appear and vanish]*

"We've identified **1,034 corporate barriers** - facilities owned by companies that won't work with us. Removing these *[facilities disappear]* leaves **1,887 real opportunities** worth **$624 million**."

#### Layer 6: The Acquisition Reality
*[Click: Layer 6 - Three-tier heat map]*

"Our operational reach analysis:"

- *[Bright blue radiates]* "**1,456 facilities in metro-adjacent areas** - these are our primary targets. **$487.3 million** in reachable new business."

- *[Cyan highlights]* "**342 facilities on highway corridors** - secondary targets worth **$112.4 million**."

- *[Gray fades]* "**89 rural facilities** - we're explicitly NOT pursuing these despite **$24 million** in potential. That's strategic discipline."

"**The new business verdict: $487.3 million in primary targets.**"

---

### COMBINED CONCLUSION
*[Click: Show both metro-adjacent layers - green and blue]*

"Here's our focused opportunity:"

- **Integration**: $41.2 million (green)
- **New Business**: $487.3 million (blue)
- **Total Reachable**: $528.5 million

"This isn't our total market - it's our **smart market**. The facilities we can efficiently serve, successfully sell to, and profitably operate."

*[Zoom out to full six-state view]*

"We're intentionally NOT pursuing **$2.4 billion** in rural and barrier-blocked opportunities. That's not leaving money on the table - that's strategic focus."

---

### Q&A PREPARATIONS

**Anticipated Question 1:** "Why ignore $2.4 billion?"
*[Click to show rural/stretched facilities in gray]*
"These facilities average 68 miles from our nearest operation. The operational cost would exceed the revenue."

**Anticipated Question 2:** "What about the independents?"
*[Toggle to show orange independent pins]*
"We do pursue larger independents over 40 beds in metro areas. But corporate chains give us 4x the facilities per sales effort."

**Anticipated Question 3:** "How confident are we in the barriers?"
*[Show X markers on barrier facilities]*
"These 1,820 barriers are verified through contracts, competitor intelligence, and failed attempts. We update quarterly."

**Anticipated Question 4:** "What if we lowered the bed threshold?"
*[Toggle to show 20-40 bed facilities]*
"Adding facilities under 40 beds brings in 2,847 locations but only $248 million in revenue - and doubles our operational footprint. The math doesn't work."

## PART 3: TECHNICAL NOTES FOR PRESENTER

### Map Controls
- **Zoom levels**: State view (show density) → Metro view (show clusters) → Facility view (show individual)
- **Toggle speed**: 0.5 second fade for smooth transitions
- **Click order**: Always follow the layer sequence - tells the story
- **Reset between stories**: Clear map completely for dramatic effect

### Presentation Tips
- Let large numbers sink in before clicking next layer
- Use specific city examples (Indianapolis, Louisville, Charlotte)
- Point out cluster patterns vs scattered rural
- Reference operational team feedback on distance constraints
- Have backup slides with detailed metrics

### Software Recommendations
- **Google My Maps**: Best for live presentation (smooth, familiar)
- **Tableau**: Best for interactive exploration during Q&A
- **PowerBI**: Best for embedding in corporate dashboards
- **KML in Google Earth**: Best for dramatic fly-through effects
