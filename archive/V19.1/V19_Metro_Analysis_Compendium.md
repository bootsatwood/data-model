| **Toledo** | OH | 11 | 0 | 8 | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | | **729** | **174** | **490** | **85** |

**Note**: Three metros from the original 12-metro target list (Northwest Indiana, Evansville, Harrisonburg-Charlottesville) had insufficient corporate facility data for inclusion in this analysis.

### 2.2 Current Market Penetration

**Overall Corporate Metro Penetration**: 23.9% (174 of 729 facilities)

This represents a **11.1 percentage point gap** to the industry benchmark of 35% market share, requiring strategic growth initiatives to close the gap.

#### Penetration by Metro

| Metro | Current Penetration | Gap to 35% | Facilities Needed |
|-------|---------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Indianapolis | 25.5% | 9.5 pts | +19 |
| Louisville | 35.1% | **ABOVE TARGET** | 0 |
| Charlotte | 19.4% | 15.6 pts | +11 |
| Lexington | 19.2% | 15.8 pts | +8 |
| Cincinnati | 18.1% | 16.9 pts | +14 |
| Columbus | 11.9% | 23.1 pts | +19 |
| Cleveland-Akron | 9.6% | 25.4 pts | +32 |
| Richmond | 11.8% | 23.2 pts | +8 |
| Toledo | 0.0% | 35.0 pts | +4 |

**Key Insight**: Louisville is the only metro currently above the 35% benchmark. Cleveland-Akron presents the largest absolute opportunity with 32 facilities needed to reach target.

### 2.3 Revenue Analysis (Scenario 2)

### 2.4 Conversion Scenarios (All Metros Combined)

Based on industry benchmarks and historical conversion rates, four growth scenarios project facility wins and revenue impact:

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Facilities Won | Total Served | Market Share | Revenue Opportunity |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Low (15%)** | 15% | +74 | 248 | 34.0% | $67.3M |
| **Medium (20%)** | 20% | +98 | 272 | 37.3% | $89.7M |

**Strategic Approach:**
- **Tier 1 Targets** (Rank 1-3): Dedicated account teams, executive engagement
- **Tier 2 Targets** (Rank 4-7): Regional sales focus, structured outreach
- **Tier 3 Targets** (Rank 8-10): Pipeline development, relationship building

---

## Part 4: Field Operations Analysis

Beyond the corporate metro focus, two additional growth channels offer substantial opportunity for field operations teams:

### 4.1 Integration Cross-Sell (Current Customers)

**Opportunity**: Expand service offerings to existing served facilities that currently receive only partial services.

| Customer Segment | Facilities | Integration Potential | Status |
|-----------------|------------|----------------------|--------|
| Integrated (Complete) | 95 | $0 | ✓ No opportunity |
| PCP-only → add MH | 46 | $6.3M | ► High priority |
| MH-only → add PCP | 208 | $28.7M | ► Primary opportunity |
| **Total Served** | **349** | **$35.0M** | - |

**Conversion Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Facilities Won | Integration Rate | Revenue |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Conservative | 20% | 51 | 41.8% | $7.0M |
| Realistic | 25% | 64 | 45.6% | $8.7M |
| Optimistic | 30% | 76 | 49.0% | $10.5M |

**Key Insight**: MH-only facilities represent 82% of integration opportunity (208 of 254 facilities). This indicates strong PCP service demand and suggests prioritizing PCP upsell initiatives.

### 4.2 Independent Facilities (≥50 beds)

**Opportunity**: Large independent facilities in metro markets offer relationship-based sales opportunities.

| Segment | Facilities | Revenue Potential |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Currently Served | 29 | - |
| Available SNF (≥50 beds) | 252 | $115.5M |
| Available ALF (≥50 beds) | 758 | $347.7M |
| **Total Available** | **1,010** | **$463.2M** |

**Conversion Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Facilities Won | Revenue |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Conservative | 10% | 101 | $46.3M |
| Realistic | 12.5% | 126 | $57.9M |
| Optimistic | 15% | 152 | $69.5M |

**Average Revenue per Facility:**
- SNF (≥50 beds): $458,333
- ALF (≥50 beds): $458,727

### 4.3 Combined Field Operations Impact

| Scenario | Integration Wins | Independent Wins | Total Facilities | Total Revenue |
|----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 51 | 101 | 152 | $53.3M |
| Realistic | 64 | 126 | 190 | $66.6M |
| Optimistic | 76 | 152 | 228 | $80.0M |

Tier B facilities are located along major transportation corridors, offering operational efficiency advantages for provider deployment while expanding beyond metro core markets.

**Total Tier B Highway Facilities**: 1,682 (6-state footprint)

| Market Segment | Facilities | % of Tier B | Revenue |
|----------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Currently Served | 263 | 15.6% | $26.3M |
| Growth Opportunity | 1,383 | 82.2% | $442.2M potential |
| Excluded (Barriers) | 54 | 3.2% | Blocked |

### 5.2 Geographic Distribution

| State | Tier B Facilities | Currently Served | Available | Revenue @ 10% |
|-------|------------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| OH | 669 | 35 | 621 | $23.5M |
| NC | 518 | 135 | 376 | $14.2M |
| IN | 201 | 45 | 151 | $5.7M |

| VA | 75 | 19 | 49 | $1.9M |
| **Total** | **1,682** | **263** | **1,383** | **$52.4M** |

### 5.3 Corridor-Based Strategy

**Primary Corridors:**
- **I-70 (East-West)**: OH, IN - 287 facilities
- **I-75 (North-South)**: OH, KY - 246 facilities
- **I-77 (North-South)**: OH, NC, SC - 198 facilities
- **I-85 (Northeast-Southwest)**: NC, SC, VA - 167 facilities
- **I-64 (East-West)**: IN, KY, VA - 134 facilities

**Recommended Approach**: Pilot program targeting high-density corridors (I-70, I-75) with 5-10% penetration goal in Year 1, scaling to 15% by Year 3.

### 5.4 Tier B Conversion Scenarios

| Scenario | Penetration Rate | Facilities Won | Revenue |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Conservative Pilot | 5% | 69 | $22.1M |
| Realistic | 10% | 138 | $44.2M |
| Optimistic | 15% | 207 | $66.3M |

## Part 6: Barrier Analysis

### 6.1 Barrier Overview (V19)

**Total Facilities with Barriers**: 848 (4.0% of database)  
**Metro Corporate Barriers**: 85 (11.7% of metro corporate facilities)

V19 shows a **38.6% reduction** in barrier count from V18 (1,383 → 848), reflecting data quality improvements and barrier resolution efforts.

### 6.2 Barrier Categories

| Barrier Type | Facilities | % of Barriers | Impact |
|--------------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Own Provider Group | 368 | 43.4% | Blocks all services |
| MH Only Opportunity | 142 | 16.7% | Blocks PCP services |
| Alliance | 119 | 14.0% | Blocks new business |
| Alliance, Own Provider Group | 113 | 13.3% | Blocks all services |
| Reputation | 40 | 4.7% | Blocks all services |
| Termination Risk | 26 | 3.1% | Blocks expansion |
| Competitor Agreement | 23 | 2.7% | Blocks new business |
| Alliance, MH Only Opportunity | 17 | 2.0% | Blocks new business |

### 6.3 Revenue Impact of Barriers

**Estimated Blocked Revenue**: $85-100M across all scenarios

Barriers permanently exclude facilities from growth calculations. The analysis focuses resources on the 490 available corporate metro facilities and 1,383 Tier B highway facilities with no impediments.

**Barrier Management Strategy:**
1. **Monitor quarterly** for barrier status changes
2. **Document resolution pathways** for competitive agreement expirations
3. **Track alliance partnerships** for potential collaboration opportunities
4. **Maintain relationship presence** at barrier facilities for future opportunity
