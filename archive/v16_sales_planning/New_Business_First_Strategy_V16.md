# New Business First Strategy
## Realistic Path to 14,500 Beds Without Counting on M&A
### Eventus Healthcare Revised Strategic Approach

---

## Executive Summary

By prioritizing **New Business as primary**, **Integration as secondary**, and **Retention/Win-Back as third**, we have **94,176 beds** available against a 14,500 bed target - a 6.5x coverage ratio. This approach doesn't rely on uncertain M&A deals and provides multiple paths to success.

---

## STRATEGY 1: NEW BUSINESS (Primary Focus)
**Available: 78,301 beds | Target Contribution: 10,000 beds**

### Tier A: Metro-Adjacent (Highest Priority)
- **Facilities**: 621
- **Beds**: 51,565
- **Revenue**: $208.0M
- **Win Rate Needed**: Only 19% to hit 10,000 beds
- **Strategy**: Focus on 40+ bed facilities in dense metros

### Tier B: Highway Corridors (Selective)
- **Facilities**: 339
- **Beds**: 26,737
- **Revenue**: $107.9M
- **Strategy**: Cherry-pick 60+ bed facilities only

### Why New Business First Makes Sense:
1. **Largest revenue pool**: $315.9M available
2. **No incumbent barriers**: Clean competitive landscape
3. **Full service package**: Higher revenue per facility
4. **M&A optionality**: Corporate wins are bonus, not required

### Realistic Capture Rates:
- **Year 1**: 5% of Tier A = 2,578 beds
- **Year 2**: 10% cumulative = 5,157 beds
- **Year 3**: 20% cumulative = 10,313 beds ✓ Target achieved

---

## STRATEGY 2: INTEGRATION (Secondary Focus)
**Available: 13,854 beds | Target Contribution: 3,500 beds**

### Stable Integration Opportunities
- **Tier A Stable**: 153 facilities, 8,288 beds
- **Tier B Stable**: 104 facilities, 5,566 beds
- **Revenue**: $39.2M (conservative approach)
- **Win Rate Needed**: 25% to hit 3,500 beds

### Why Integration is Secondary:
1. **Lower revenue per facility**: ~$150K vs $400K new business
2. **Existing barriers**: Some facilities locked with competitors
3. **Contract complexity**: Need to navigate existing relationships
4. **But**: Higher margin (62% vs 35%) makes it worthwhile

### Realistic Capture Rates:
- **Year 1**: 15% = 2,078 beds
- **Year 2**: 25% = 3,464 beds ✓ Target achieved
- **Year 3**: 35% = 4,849 beds

---

## STRATEGY 3: RETENTION & WIN-BACK (Third Priority)
**Available: 2,021 beds | Target Contribution: 1,000 beds**

### A. RETENTION - Stop the Bleeding First
**Yellow Status (At-Risk)**: 32 facilities, 1,386 beds
- **Current Revenue at Risk**: $4.2M annually
- **Action**: Immediate intervention required
- **Success Rate Target**: 75% retention = 1,040 beds ✓

### B. WIN-BACK - Recapture Lost Accounts
**Red Status (Termed)**: 14 facilities, 635 beds
- **Lost Revenue**: $1.9M annually
- **Primary States**: OH (7), NC (3), KY (2), IN (2)
- **Success Rate Target**: 30% win-back = 191 beds

### Why This is Third Priority:
1. **Hardest battles**: Already lost or losing
2. **Reputation risk**: Why did we lose them?
3. **But**: Cheapest to implement if successful
4. **Critical**: Stop Yellow from becoming Red

## Revised Sales Tier Alignment

### Tier 1: INFILL (OH + NC)
**Reframed for New Business First**

| Metric | Integration | New Business | Retention | Total |
|--------|------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Facilities | 48 | 145 | 10 | 203 |
| Beds | 3,130 | 12,362 | 375 | 15,867 |
| Target | 1,000 | 4,000 | 0 | 5,000 |
| Coverage | 313% | 309% | -- | 317% |

### Tier 2: EDGE EXPANSION (TN + PA)
**Now Unnecessary Given Coverage**
- Original Target: 7,000 beds
- Recommendation: **Defer** - focus on existing 6 states
- Future Option: Expand only after 50% capture in current markets

### Tier 3: WHALE/CORPORATE M&A
**Now Optional Upside, Not Required**
- Original Target: 2,500 beds
- New Position: **Opportunistic only**
- If it happens: Accelerates timeline
- If not: Still achieve goals organically
