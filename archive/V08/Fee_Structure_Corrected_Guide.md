## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS BY REVENUE TYPE

### **1. CURRENT REVENUE ($160.4M)** - What We Earn Today

**Composition:**
- PCP: $67.7M (42%)
- **MH: $69.5M (43%)** ← Highest current contributor
- CCM: $2.8M (2%)
- SS: $20.4M (13%)

**Insight:** Current revenue is almost evenly split between PCP (42%) and MH (43%), with minimal CCM/SS because most current customers aren't fully integrated yet.

---

### **2. INTEGRATION REVENUE ($164.6M)** - Upsell Opportunity

**Composition:**
- **PCP: $95.1M (58%)** ← Highest integration opportunity
- MH: $10.8M (7%)
- CCM: $7.0M (4%)
- **SS: $51.7M (31%)** ← Second highest

**Insight:** Integration opportunity is dominated by PCP (58%), meaning most current customers are MH-only and would benefit from adding PCP services. Shared Savings (31%) represents significant additional value through integration.

---

### **3. NEW BUSINESS REVENUE ($4,416.2M)** - New Customer Potential

**Composition:**
- **PCP: $2,201.4M (50%)** ← Largest component
- MH: $1,056.7M (24%)
- CCM: $139.0M (3%)
- SS: $1,019.1M (23%)

**Insight:** New business revenue reflects full integrated packages. PCP drives half of all new business value, with Shared Savings contributing nearly a quarter (23%).

---

### **4. TOTAL POTENTIAL ($4,580.9M)** - Combined Opportunity

**Composition:**
- **PCP: $2,296.5M (50%)** ← Half of all potential
- MH: $1,067.5M (23%)
- CCM: $146.0M (3%)
- SS: $1,070.8M (23%)

**Insight:** Total potential shows PCP and Shared Savings as the two largest value drivers (50% and 23% respectively). CCM remains smallest (3%) but is essential for integrated packages.

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **PCP is the Foundation:**
- Accounts for 50% of total potential revenue
- Critical for both current operations and growth
- Drives half of all new business opportunity

### **Shared Savings is the Value-Add:**
- Contributes 23% of total potential
- Provides significant differentiation
- Only 13% of current revenue (huge growth opportunity)

### **MH Services are Substantial:**
- 23% of total potential despite 0.50 adjuster
- Currently our strongest service (43% of current revenue)
- Integration opportunity is lower (only 7%) because many current customers already have MH

### **CCM is the Enabler:**
- Smallest component (3% of total)
- But essential for integrated packages
- Required for CCM and Shared Savings benefits

## 📈 SCENARIO VARIATIONS

### **Current Revenue Changes Across Scenarios:**
- **S1 → S3:** Increases from $160.4M to $177.1M (+$16.7M)
- **Why:** Package enhancements make existing customers more valuable
- **Driven by:** Adding CCM to PCP and MH packages

### **Integration Revenue Changes Across Scenarios:**
- **S1 → S3:** Decreases from $164.6M to $148.0M (-$16.6M)
- **Why:** Less room to upsell when packages already enhanced
- **Trade-off:** Current revenue gain = Integration revenue loss

### **New Business Revenue Stays Constant:**
- **All Scenarios:** $4,416.2M (unchanged)
- **Why:** New customers always get full integrated package
- **Implication:** Scenarios only affect current customer value
