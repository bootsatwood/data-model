# V21 Corporate Tiering Methodology — Ops View
## Rule-Based Partner Segmentation Framework

**Version**: 21.2
**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Status**: DRAFT  
**Requested By**: Clinical Operations Team  
**Primary Analyst**: GTM Strategy  

---

## 1. Purpose & Background

### 1.1 Purpose

This document describes an alternative corporate tiering methodology requested by the Clinical Operations team. It represents a structural departure from the Sales team's V20 weighted-scoring approach, prioritizing **objective, rule-based criteria** over subjective point accumulation.

### 1.2 Why Two Views?

The Sales team (V20) and Ops team (V21) have different use cases for corporate tiering:

| Perspective | Primary Question | Methodology Preference |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Sales (V20)** | "Which partners should we invest relationship-building effort in?" | Weighted scoring incorporating relationship quality, strategic influence, tech readiness |
| **Ops (V21)** | "How do we allocate clinical resources and capacity planning?" | Objective criteria (geography, revenue potential) with subjective factors as advisory input |

The Ops View separates "what we can measure" from "what requires judgment" to enable cleaner capacity planning and resource allocation decisions.

The uploaded slide ("Reconciling our frameworks") established the target structure:

```
                                    Objective                          Subjective
Tiers                          # MUOs  # facilities  $ revenue  $ revenue    % Eventus
                                                                potential    fit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
T1: MUO in multi-state (3+) 
    or $10M+ revenue potential    17      930        $49.3M     $252.6M      38%

T2: MUO in 1-2 states and 
    $4-10M potential              16      272        $11.3M     $90.3M       18%

T3: MUO in single states and 
    <$4M potential                37      503        $36.1M     $85.9M       25%
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
T4: MUO – structurally low-
    potential (hard barriers)     13      366        $13.9M     $2.8M        N/A

T5: Non-MUO                       —       1,122      $10.0M     $402.4M      N/A
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Key Design Elements from Slide:**
- Vertical line separates **Objective** (left) from **Subjective** (right) criteria
- Tier assignment driven by objective criteria only
- Subjective "% Eventus Fit" is advisory, does not determine tier
- Hard Barriers (T4) explicitly separated from scoreable tiers
- Non-MUO (T5) included as distinct population

---

## 3. Framework Comparison: V20 vs V21

| Aspect | V20 (Sales View) | V21 (Ops View) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Tier logic** | 6-dimension weighted score (0-100) | Rule-based: Geography + Revenue Potential |
| **Primary criteria** | Blended subjective + objective | **Objective only**: State count + Total Opportunity |
| **Subjective inputs** | Baked into tier score (60% of weighting) | Separated as "% Eventus Fit" (advisory only) |
| **Point system** | Yes (max 100 points) | **No** — threshold-based assignment |
| **Tiers** | T1, T2, T3 | T1, T2, T3, T4 (Hard Barriers), T5 (Non-MUO) |
| **Hard barriers** | Included in scoring (low scores) | **Explicit exclusion category** |
| **Non-MUO population** | Not included | **Explicitly quantified** |
| **Tier thresholds** | Score ranges (50-100, 25-49, <25) | Revenue + geography rules |

## 4. Dimension Mapping: V20 → V21

### 4.1 The Six V20 Dimensions

| V20 Dimension | Weight | Type (V20) |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| 1. Enterprise Reach | 20% | Objective |
| 2. Revenue Potential | 20% | Objective |
| 3. Integration Readiness | 15% | Subjective |
| 4. Strategic Influence | 15% | Subjective |
| 5. Relationship Strength | 15% | Subjective |
| 6. AI/Tech Adoption | 15% | Subjective |

**Observation:** 60% of V20 weighting comes from subjective dimensions.

### 4.2 V21 Mapping

| V20 Dimension | V21 Treatment | Explanation |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Enterprise Reach | **Scored** → # Facilities, State Count | Objective, left of line |
| Revenue Potential | **Scored** → $ Revenue Potential | Objective, left of line |
| Integration Readiness | **Not scored** — proxy is Current Revenue | If they're willing to integrate, they likely already have (revealed preference) |
| Strategic Influence | **Not scored** — proxy is State Count | Multi-state reach implies enterprise-level connections |
| Relationship Strength | **Scored** → % Eventus Fit | Subjective, right of line |
| AI/Tech Adoption | **Scored** → % Eventus Fit | Subjective, right of line |

### 4.3 Rationale for Proxy Treatment

**Integration Readiness → Current Revenue (Proxy)**
- If an entity is *willing* to integrate, they likely already *are* integrated at some facilities
- Integrated facilities generate Current Revenue
- An entity with high Current Revenue relative to their footprint has *revealed* integration readiness through behavior, not just stated intent

**Strategic Influence → State Count (Proxy)**
- V20 defined Strategic Influence as: payer/ACO connections, REIT affiliations, enterprise-level influence
- Multi-state operators (3+ states) typically *have* those connections — that's how they grew
- A single-state operator is less likely to have REIT/ISNP/enterprise influence

### 4.4 Net Effect

- **V20:** 6 dimensions explicitly scored and weighted
- **V21:** 4 dimensions scored (2 objective, 2 subjective), 2 dimensions treated as proxies (already captured by objective metrics)

---

## 5. Tier Definitions (V21 Ops View)

### 5.1 Overview

| Tier | Name | Primary Criteria | # MUOs | # Facilities | $ Revenue | $ Rev Potential | Avg Fit |
|------|------|------------------|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **T1** | Strategic Enterprise | Multi-state (3+) **OR** $10M+ | 17 | 930 | $49.3M | $252.6M | 38% |
| **T2** | Growth & Expansion | 1-2 states **AND** $4-10M | 16 | 272 | $11.3M | $90.3M | 18% |
| **T3** | Single-State / Watch | Single state **AND** <$4M | 37 | 503 | $36.1M | $85.9M | 25% |
| **T4** | Hard Barriers | Structural blockers | 13 | 366 | $13.9M | $2.8M | N/A |
| **T5** | Non-MUO | Independents + small corps | — | 1,122 | $10.0M | $402.4M | N/A |

### 5.2 Decision Rules (Pseudocode)

```
FUNCTION assign_tier(entity):
    
    IF entity has Hard Barrier:
        RETURN T4
    
    IF entity.facilities < 7 OR entity has no metro presence:
        RETURN T5  // Does not qualify as MUO
    
    // MUO Tiering Logic
    IF entity.Total_Opportunity >= $10M:
        RETURN T1
    
    IF entity.State_Count >= 3 AND entity.Total_Opportunity >= $4M:
        RETURN T1
    
    IF entity.Total_Opportunity >= $4M:
        RETURN T2
    
    RETURN T3
```

### 5.3 Key Threshold Decisions

| Threshold | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| T1 revenue floor | $10M | Enterprise-scale opportunity justifies C-suite engagement |
| T1 geography (with $4M+) | 3+ states | Multi-state reach indicates enterprise operator |
| T2 revenue floor | $4M | Meaningful growth opportunity worth CAM investment |
| T3 ceiling | <$4M | Limited opportunity, field-managed |
| MUO facility minimum | 7 | Consistent with V20 definition |

### 5.4 Revenue Override Geography

**Important:** Revenue potential can override geography requirements for T1.

**Example:** American Senior Communities
- State Count: 1 (Indiana only)
- Total Opportunity: $28.8M
- Tier Assignment: **T1** (revenue override)

---

## 6. Scenario 2 Revenue Column Definitions

### 6.1 Column Structure

| Column | Definition | Formula |
|--------|------------|---------|
| `Current_Revenue` | Revenue from facilities we currently serve | Census × Fee (for served facilities) |
| `Integration_Revenue` | Upsell opportunity at served facilities not fully integrated | Additional services available |
| `New_Business_Revenue` | Revenue potential from facilities we don't serve | Census × Fee (for unserved facilities) |
| `Total_Potential_Revenue` | Total growth opportunity | Integration_Revenue + New_Business_Revenue |

### 6.2 Validation

```
Total_Potential_Revenue = Integration_Revenue + New_Business_Revenue ✓

Full Dataset Sums:
- Current_Revenue:         $182.44M
- Integration_Revenue:     $143.16M  
- New_Business_Revenue:    $6,903.74M
- Total_Potential_Revenue: $7,046.91M
```

### 6.3 Usage for Tiering

**Brooke's "Total Opportunity" column aligns with Scenario 2's `Total_Potential_Revenue`.**

Validation check (sample entities):
| Entity | Brooke Total Opp | Scenario 2 Total_Potential |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Trilogy Health Services | $37.2M | $37.24M ✓ |
| Saber Healthcare Group | $30.8M | $30.77M ✓ |
| American Senior Communities | $28.8M | $28.76M ✓ |

---

## 7. Subjective Scoring: % Eventus Fit

### 7.1 Composition

% Eventus Fit consolidates two V20 subjective dimensions:

| Component | V20 Source | Scale | Weight in Fit |
|-----------|------------|-------|---------------|
| Relationship Strength | Sheet1, Column Q | 1-5 | 50% |
| AI/Tech Adoption | Sheet1, Column T | 1-5 | 50% |

### 7.2 Calculation

```
% Eventus Fit = (Relationship_Strength + AI_Tech_Adoption) / 10 × 100
```

**Example:**
- Entity with Relationship Strength = 4, AI/Tech = 3 → (4+3)/10 = **70%**
- Entity with Relationship Strength = 2, AI/Tech = 1 → (2+1)/10 = **30%**

### 7.3 Why Only Two Dimensions?

Per the dimension mapping (§4), Integration Readiness and Strategic Influence are **not scored** in V21 because:
- Integration Readiness → Already captured by Current Revenue (revealed preference)
- Strategic Influence → Already captured by State Count (geographic proxy)

This avoids double-counting and keeps the subjective score focused on relationship quality and technology readiness.

## 8. Tier Assignment Validation

### 8.1 Methodology

Applied decision rules (§5.2) to all entities in Brooke's Sheet2 and compared against her assigned tiers.

### 8.2 Tier Changes Required

| Entity | Brooke Assigned | Corrected Tier | Gap | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-----|--------|
| Sunrise | T1 | T3 | -2 | $0.81M — below $4M threshold |
| Terra Bella | T1 | T3 | -2 | $0.18M — below $4M threshold |
| Brookdale Senior Living | T1 | T3 | -2 | $2.0M — below $4M threshold |
| Priority Life Care | T1 | T3 | -2 | $3.2M — below $4M threshold |
| Health Care Management Group | T1 | T3 | -2 | $3.7M — below $4M threshold |
| Morning Pointe Senior Living | T2 | T3 | -1 | $1.8M — below $4M threshold |
| Pavilion Healthcare | T2 | T3 | -1 | $1.4M — below $4M threshold |
| Gardant Management Solutions | T2 | T1 | +1 | $8.0M + 3 states — meets T1 rule |
| Consulate/Nspire/Raydiant | T2 | T1 | +1 | $7.1M + 4 states — meets T1 rule |
| TLC Management | T2 | T1 | +1 | $5.0M + 3 states — meets T1 rule |
| ALG | None | T3 | New | $0.83M — below $4M threshold |
| Clearview | None | T3 | New | $0.62M — below $4M threshold |
| Navion | None | T3 | New | $0.16M — below $4M threshold |
| Topaz | None | T3 | New | $1.14M — below $4M threshold |
| Divine Healthcare Management | None | T3 | New | $2.63M — below $4M threshold |

### 8.3 Corrected Tier Counts

| Tier | Brooke's Count | Corrected Count | Net Change |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| T1 | 19 | 17 | -2 (5 demoted, 3 promoted) |
| T2 | 21 | 16 | -5 (3 promoted to T1, 2 demoted to T3) |
| T3 | 25 | 37 | +12 (7 demoted from T1/T2, 5 newly assigned) |
| T4 | 13 | 13 | 0 |

---

## 9. Tier 4: Hard Barriers

### 9.1 Definition

Entities with **structural blockers** that prevent engagement regardless of revenue potential or geographic fit.

### 9.2 T4 Summary

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| # MUOs | 13 | Corporate entities with barriers |
| # Facilities | 366 | In 6-state footprint |
| We Serve | 164 | 45% penetration |
| $ Current Revenue | $13.9M | Revenue at risk |
| $ Blocked Potential | $2.8M | Opportunity we cannot pursue |

**Interpretation:** The low blocked potential ($2.8M) reflects that we already serve many T4 facilities heavily. The barrier means we can't *grow* with them, not that we can't serve them today. The $13.9M current revenue could be considered "at risk" given the structural issues.

### 9.3 T4 Entity List (13 entities)

| Entity | Barrier Type | Facilities | We Serve | Current Rev | Blocked Potential |
|--------|--------------|------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Hill Valley | Own provider group | 30 | 7 | $1.40M | $0.00M |
| Embassy | Own provider group | 28 | 3 | $0.24M | $0.00M |
| Cardon | Own provider group | 34 | 6 | $0.22M | $0.00M |
| Signature | Own provider group | 63 | 29 | $2.99M | $0.00M |
| Communicare | Own provider group | 68 | 10 | $0.37M | $0.00M |
| Exceptional Living | Own provider group | 9 | 1 | $0.28M | $0.00M |
| Portopiccolo | Alliance (Telos) | 2 | 1 | $0.05M | $0.56M |
| Encore | Alliance | 38 | 36 | $2.18M | $0.00M |
| Bluegrass | Alliance | 41 | 40 | $2.13M | $0.00M |
| Venza | Alliance | 4 | 3 | $1.22M | $0.79M |
| MFA | Alliance (VA) | 8 | 8 | $0.43M | $0.00M |
| Aventura | Recent LOB | 13 | 10 | $1.97M | $1.30M |
| Eastern | Recent LOB | 22 | 8 | $0.37M | $0.15M |
| Journey | Explicit rejection | 6 | 2 | $0.10M | $0.00M |
| **TOTAL** | | **366** | **164** | **$13.94M** | **$2.79M** |

## 10. Tier 5: Non-MUO

### 10.1 Definition

Facilities in metro markets that do not belong to a Multi-Unit Operator (MUO):
- **Independent facilities** — no corporate affiliation
- **Small corporates** — entities with <7 facilities nationally

### 10.2 Composition Summary

| Component | Facilities | SNF | ALF | Total Potential Revenue | We Serve | Don't Serve |
|-----------|------------|-----|-----|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Independents in Metro | 904 | 220 | 684 | $334.2M | 59 | 845 |
| Non-MUO Corporates in Metro | 218 | 59 | 159 | $68.3M | 47 | 171 |
| **Total T5** | **1,122** | **279** | **843** | **$402.4M** | **106** | **1,016** |

### 10.3 T5 by Metro Market

| Metro | Facilities | Total Potential Revenue |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| Cleveland-Akron | 271 | $102.3M |
| Columbus | 149 | $49.7M |
| Cincinnati | 138 | $48.6M |
| Richmond | 98 | $46.4M |
| Indianapolis | 108 | $42.6M |
| Charlotte | 84 | $29.7M |
| Louisville | 81 | $25.5M |
| Toledo | 55 | $19.6M |
| Northwest Indiana | 31 | $10.9M |
| Evansville | 30 | $10.8M |
| Lexington | 38 | $10.1M |
| Harrisonburg-Charlottesville | 39 | $6.2M |

### 10.4 Top 10 T5 Facilities by Revenue Potential

| Facility | Corporate/Owner | State | Rev Potential |
|----------|-----------------|-------|---------------|
| Pinnacle West Apartments | Neighborcare Woodlake | IN | $4.79M |
| The Campus of King David | Wigg Realty | OH | $3.92M |
| Imperial Plaza | Imperial Propco | VA | $3.84M |
| Westminster Canterbury Richmond | Westminster-Canterbury | VA | $2.65M |
| Windsor Run | Windsor Run LLC | NC | $2.53M |
| Matthews Glen | ACTS Retirement | NC | $2.31M |
| Crestwood Village South | Crestwood Village | IN | $2.23M |
| Lakeside Manor | Spurling Properties | IN | $2.07M |
| Acclaim at Carriage Hill | BRG Carriage Hill | VA | $1.93M |
| Avery Point | Avery Point LLC | VA | $1.86M |

### 10.5 Discrepancy Note

The original slide template showed T5 as "488 facilities, $104M." This analysis using V20 Scenario 2 data yields **1,122 facilities, $402.4M**.

**Resolution:** This document uses V20 calculated values as authoritative.
