## Revenue Calculation Validation

### Current Revenue Pattern: S1 < S2 < S3 ✓ PASS
- S1: $173.3M
- S2: $202.7M (+16.9%)
- S3: $228.0M (+31.6%)

**Explanation**: Higher fees + expanded service packages in S2/S3 increase current revenue for existing customers.

### Integration Revenue Pattern: S1 < S2 < S3 ⚠️ OBSERVED
- S1: $137.7M
- S2: $142.2M (+3.3%)
- S3: $150.5M (+9.3%)

**Explanation**: While service package opportunities decrease in S2/S3 (already include more services), the higher fee levels more than offset the reduced opportunities, resulting in higher absolute integration revenue values.

### New Business Revenue Pattern: Increases with Fee Levels ✓ EXPECTED
- S1: $6.81B
- S2: $7.49B (+10.0%)
- S3: $8.17B (+20.0%)

**Explanation**: New Business always receives full integrated package. Revenue increases proportionally with fee levels (S2 = +10%, S3 = +20%).

### Total Potential Revenue Pattern: S1 < S2 < S3 ✓ OBSERVED
- S1: $6.94B
- S2: $7.63B (+9.9%)
- S3: $8.32B (+19.8%)

**Explanation**: Combined effect of integration and new business increases follows fee level increases.

## Key Technical Notes

### Service Package Logic
- **Current Revenue** reflects what customer currently receives
- **Integration Revenue** represents gap to full integrated package
- Different scenarios have different starting packages (S1 baseline, S2 PCP-enhanced, S3 comprehensive)
- This creates the pattern where higher scenarios reduce integration opportunities but increase absolute values due to higher fees

### Barrier Application
- All barriers block BOTH Integration and New Business potential revenue
- Current Revenue is NEVER blocked (preserves existing business relationships)
- Barriers are typically corporate-level (affect all facilities under parent company)
- 1,381 of 1,383 barrier facilities are Corporate-owned

### Ownership Classification
- Uses Four-Rule Count-Based methodology from V17.1
- Single-facility LLCs classified as Independent (not Corporate)
- 1,026 true multi-facility chains identified
- Classification affects revenue reporting filters (Corporate-only for SAM/SOM revenue)

## Comparison to V15 Baseline

| Metric | V15 | V18 | Change |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| Facilities | 17,434 | 21,023 | +3,589 (+20.6%) |
| SNF Facilities | 14,750 | 15,234 | +484 (+3.3%) |
| ALF Facilities | 2,684 | 5,789 | +3,105 (+115.7%) |
| Current Revenue (S1) | ~$150M* | $173.3M | +$23.3M (+15.5%) |
| Total Potential (S1) | $5.24B | $6.94B | +$1.70B (+32.5%) |

*V15 value estimated based on historical patterns

### Sources of Growth
1. **Database Expansion**: V17.1 integration added 3,589 facilities
2. **Fee Structure Updates**: SNF +6.3%, ALF -0.7%
3. **Geographic Expansion**: Pennsylvania and Tennessee priority markets
4. **Improved Data Quality**: GPS deduplication and corporate name harmonization
