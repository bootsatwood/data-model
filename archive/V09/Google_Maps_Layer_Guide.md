**Layers ON:** 5-SNF, 5-ALF (Red)  
**Layers OFF:** All others  
**Insight:** These 849 facilities are existing corporate relationships we serve despite rural location - "can't say no" when they ask for expansion

**Layers ON:** 1-SNF, 2-SNF, 3-SNF, 4-SNF  
**Layers OFF:** All ALF layers and rural layers

**Layers ON:** 1-ALF, 2-ALF, 3-ALF, 4-ALF  
**Layers OFF:** All SNF layers and rural layers  
**Insight:** Pure ALF metro view for ALF-focused strategy discussions

**Layers ON:** All 16 layers  
**View:** Full state or region  
**Insight:** Complete picture showing strategic focus areas vs deprioritized territories

## PRESENTATION TALKING POINTS

### Metro Focus Justification
> "The blue and green clusters show why we focus on metros - our targets are concentrated within 15 miles of city centers, making operations efficient. Compare that to the yellow scatter of rural facilities - same revenue potential per facility, but 3x the operational cost to serve."

### Integration vs New Business
> "Green markers are our existing corporate relationships in metros - $26.5M in upsell opportunity. Blue markers are $222.7M in new corporate business. Together that's nearly $250M of metro corporate opportunity."

### Rural Corporate Protection
> "These red markers aren't targets we're actively pursuing - they're corporate relationships we already have in rural areas. When Pruitt or Genesis asks us to add services at a rural facility, we say yes. That's $45.3M in integration revenue we protect."

### SNF vs ALF Split
> "Toggle between circles and diamonds to see facility type distribution. You'll notice ALFs cluster tighter in suburbs while SNFs spread into secondary markets. This informs where we deploy specialty resources."

### What We Don't Chase
> "The gray markers show what we're NOT pursuing - rural independent facilities. They're scattered, each requires individual relationship building, and the operational burden doesn't justify the revenue. That's 1,188 facilities we consciously deprioritize."
