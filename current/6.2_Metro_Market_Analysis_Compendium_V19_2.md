## 1. Metro Market Definitions

### 1.1 Twelve Priority Metros

Analysis covers **12 metropolitan markets** within the 6-state operational footprint, defined by 15-mile radius from city center.

| State | Metro | Center City | V19.1 Facilities |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| OH | Cleveland-Akron | Cleveland, Akron | 350 |
| OH | Columbus | Columbus | 193 |
| OH | Cincinnati | Cincinnati | 205 |
| OH | Toledo | Toledo | 83 |
| IN | Indianapolis | Indianapolis | 202 |
| IN | Northwest Indiana | Gary | 61 |
| IN | Evansville | Evansville | 60 |
| KY | Louisville | Louisville | 150 |
| KY | Lexington | Lexington | 63 |
| NC | Charlotte | Charlotte | 133 |
| VA | Richmond | Richmond | 114 |
| VA | Harrisonburg-Charlottesville | Harrisonburg, Charlottesville | 53 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **1,667** |

**Note:** Metro_Assignment column in database identifies which metro each facility belongs to. Facilities outside 15-mile radius have null Metro_Assignment.

### 1.2 Geographic Classification Reference

| Tier | Definition | V19.1 Count |
|------|------------|-------------|
| A_Metro | Within 15 miles of designated metro center | 2,039 |
| B_Highway | Within 10 miles of major exits on I-65, I-71, I-75, I-77, I-85 | 1,250 |
| C_Rural | All other facilities | 17,641 |

**V19.1 Limitation:** Metro_Assignment is only populated for 12 priority metros (1,667 facilities). The remaining 372 A_Metro facilities are in non-priority metros. See Core Rulebook Section 2.8.2 for details.

---

## 2. Filter Structure

### 2.1 Progressive Filtering Logic

Each level applies increasingly restrictive filters, focusing from national universe to priority metro opportunities.

| Level | Geographic Filter | Ownership | Barriers | Contract Status |
|-------|------------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **TAM** | All states (national) | Corporate only | No filter | No filter |
| **SAM** | Existing + Priority states | Corporate only | Minus barriers | No filter |
| **SOM** | Existing states only | Corporate only | Minus barriers | No filter |
| **Metro Markets** | 12 metros (Metro_Assignment) | Corporate only | Minus barriers | Green only |

### 2.2 Filter Definitions

**Ownership:** Corporate only at all levels (Independent facilities excluded from this analysis)

**State Classifications:**
- Existing: IN, KY, NC, OH, SC, VA
- Priority: IA, MN, IL, MI, PA, WI, MT
- Existing + Priority: Combined for SAM filter

**Barriers:** Facilities with Barrier column populated are excluded from SAM, SOM, and Metro levels. Cardon & Associates has permanent barrier (34 facilities).

**Contract Status:** Only "Green" status facilities included in Metro Markets (Yellow and Red excluded)

---

## 3. Revenue Calculation Basis

### 3.1 Fee Structure (From Core Rulebook V19.2 Section 3)

**CRITICAL:** All scenarios use the SAME fee structure. Scenarios differ by SERVICE PACKAGES, NOT by fee multipliers.

| Service | SNF Base | SNF Adjusted | ALF Base | ALF Adjusted |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| PCP | $3,078.00 | $3,078.00 | $2,084.00 | $2,084.00 |
| MH | $1,211.00 | $605.50 | $1,431.00 | $715.50 |
| CCM | $360.00 | $108.00 | $360.00 | $108.00 |
| SS | $4,800.00 | $792.00 | $4,800.00 | $792.00 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$4,583.50** | | **$3,699.50** |

### 3.2 Scenario 2 Service Packages

This analysis uses **Scenario 2 (PCP Enhanced)** as the reference scenario for revenue calculations.

| Service Type | Current Revenue Package | Integration Potential |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| PCP Only | PCP + CCM(adj) + SS(adj) | MH(adj) |
| MH Only | MH(adj) | PCP + CCM(adj) + SS(adj) |
| Integrated | PCP + MH(adj) + CCM(adj) + SS(adj) | $0 |

**New Business Revenue:** Always Census × TOTAL (full integrated package)

### 3.3 Revenue Column Definitions

| Column | Definition | Calculation |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Current Revenue** | Revenue from currently served facilities | Sum from Scenario 2 file |
| **Integration Revenue** | Cross-sell opportunity for served facilities | Sum from Scenario 2 file |
| **New Business Revenue** | New customer opportunity for unserved facilities | Sum from Scenario 2 file |
| **Total Potential** | Combined growth opportunity | Integration + New Business |

**Note:** Total Potential does NOT include Current Revenue. It represents incremental opportunity.

## 4. Market Segmentation Tables

### 4.1 Per-Metro Segmentation

For each metro, produce this segmentation table:

| Market Segment | Facilities | % of Metro | Revenue (S2) | Status |
|----------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Current Customers | X | XX% | $X.XM | ✓ Already serving |
| Growth Opportunity | X | XX% | $X.XM | ► Available to pursue |
| Excluded (Barriers) | X | XX% | $X.XM | ✗ Permanently blocked |
| **Total Metro** | X | 100% | $X.XM | - |

### 4.2 All-Metro Rollup

| Metro | Current Customers | Growth Opportunity | Barriers | Total | Total Potential (S2) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Cleveland-Akron | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Columbus | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Cincinnati | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Toledo | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Indianapolis | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Northwest Indiana | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Evansville | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Louisville | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Lexington | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Charlotte | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Richmond | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| Harrisonburg-Charlottesville | X | X | X | X | $X.XM |
| **TOTAL** | XXX | XXX | XXX | XXX | $XX.XM |

## 5. Conversion Scenarios

### 5.1 Standard Conversion Rates

| Scenario | Rate | Use Case |
|----------|------|----------|
| Low | 15% | Conservative planning |
| Medium | 20% | Recommended target |
| High | 25% | Stretch goal |
| Industry Maximum | 35-40% | Theoretical ceiling |

### 5.2 Conversion Scenario Table Format

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Facilities Won | Total Served | Market Share | Revenue Opportunity |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Current State | - | - | XXX | XX% | $X.XM (current) |
| Low (15%) | 15% | +XX | XXX | XX% | $X.XM |
| Medium (20%) | 20% | +XX | XXX | XX% | $X.XM |
| High (25%) | 25% | +XX | XXX | XX% | $X.XM |
| Industry Max | 35% | +XX | XXX | XX% | $X.XM |

**Calculation:**
- Facilities Won = Growth Opportunity × Conversion Rate
- Total Served = Current Customers + Facilities Won
- Market Share = Total Served / Total Metro
- Revenue Opportunity = Facilities Won × Average Revenue per Facility

### 5.3 Saturation Analysis

For each metro, calculate path to 35% market share:

| Metro | Current Penetration | Gap to 35% | Facilities Needed |
|-------|---------------------|------------|-------------------|
| [Metro Name] | XX% | XX pts | +XX |

---

## 6. Corporate Rankings

### 6.1 Ranking Methodology

Rank corporate entities by Total Opportunity (Integration + New Business) within Metro Markets filter:
- Metro_Assignment not null
- Corporate only
- No barriers
- Contract Status = Green

### 6.2 Top Corporate Table Format

| Rank | Corporate Name | Total Facilities | We Serve | Current Revenue | Integration Opp | New Biz Opp | Total Opportunity |
|------|----------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | [Name] | XX | XX | $X.XM | $X.XM | $X.XM | $X.XM |
| 2 | [Name] | XX | XX | $X.XM | $X.XM | $X.XM | $X.XM |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 6.3 Standard Rankings to Produce

| Table | Scope | Count |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Top 75 Metro | All 12 metros combined | 75 entities |
| Top 20 per Metro | Each metro individually | 20 per metro |
| Top 4 Metros × Top 3 | Priority focus | 12 entities |
