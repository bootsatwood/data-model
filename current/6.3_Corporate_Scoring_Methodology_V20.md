**Version**: 20.0  
**Date**: December 2025  
**Status**: PRODUCTION

---

## 2. Input Files

| File | Purpose | Records |
|------|---------|---------|
| Book1_Scoring.xlsx | Corporate scoring input (from Brooke) | 70 entities |
| Combined_Database_FINAL_V19_1_Enhanced.xlsx | Facility database | 20,943 facilities |

---

## 3. Scoring Model

### 3.1 Six Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Multiplier | Max Points |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|
| Enterprise Reach | 20% | ×4 | 20 |
| Integration Readiness | 15% | ×3 | 15 |
| Strategic Influence | 15% | ×3 | 15 |
| Revenue Potential | 20% | ×4 | 20 |
| Relationship Strength | 15% | ×3 | 15 |
| AI/Tech Adoption | 15% | ×3 | 15 |
| **Total** | **100%** | | **100** |

### 3.2 Scoring Rubric (1-5 Scale)

| Score | Enterprise Reach | Integration Readiness | Strategic Influence | Revenue Potential | Relationship Strength |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 1-4 facilities | Single service, avoids | No affiliations | <$250K | At-risk/never responds |
| 2 | 5-9 facilities | MH only, receptive | Minimal local | $250-499K | Local, no corp alignment |
| 3 | 10-19 fac / 1-2 states | MH only, responsive | Regional reputation | $500-999K | Responsive when prompted |
| 4 | 20-39 facilities | MH+PCP engaged | Payer/ACO connected | $1.0-1.99M | Collaborative, open |
| 5 | 40+ fac / 5+ states | Fully integrated | REIT/ISNP/Enterprise | >$2M | Embedded partnership |

### 3.3 Total Score Calculation

```
Total Score = (Enterprise Reach × 4) + (Integration Readiness × 3) + 
              (Strategic Influence × 3) + (Revenue Potential × 4) + 
              (Relationship Strength × 3) + (AI/Tech Adoption × 3)
```

## 4. Tier Definitions

| Tier | Name | Score Range | Count | Resource Allocation |
|------|------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| **T1** | Strategic Enterprise | 50-100 | 22 | 60% |
| **T2** | Growth & Expansion | 25-49 | 36 | 30% |
| **T3** | Retention/Watch | <25 | 12 | 10% |

### 4.1 Engagement Models by Tier

| Tier | Executive Access | Account Management | Review Cadence |
|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| T1 | C-suite | Dedicated CAM | Quarterly exec reviews |
| T2 | Regional leadership | CAM-led, rotational clinical | Regular QBRs |
| T3 | Facility level | Field-managed | Annual touchpoints |

---

## 5. MUO Criteria

### 5.1 Multi-Unit Operator Definition

An entity qualifies as an MUO if it meets BOTH criteria:
1. **7+ facilities** nationally
2. **At least 1 facility** in a metro market (12 priority metros)

### 5.2 Criteria Application

| Criterion | Book1_Scoring (Original) | MUO Framework |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Facility Count | >7 required | 7+ required |
| Metro Presence | **NOT required** | **Required** |

**Key Finding:** Book1_Scoring included entities with 7+ facilities regardless of metro presence. The stricter MUO definition requires both.

---

## 6. Crosswalk Process

### 6.1 Name Standardization

Seven entities required name mapping between workbook and database:

| Workbook Name | Database Name | Facilities | Issue |
|---------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Topaz | TOPAZ HEALTHCARE | 11 | Missing suffix |
| Kissito | KISSITO HEALTHCARE | 13 | Missing suffix |
| Terra Bella | TERRABELLA SENIOR LIVING | 11 | Spacing + suffix |
| Sunrise | SUNRISE SENIOR LIVING | 11 | Missing suffix |
| Momentous Health | MOMENTUS HEALTH | 1 | Spelling difference |
| Carrolton | CARROLTON FACILTY MANAGEMENT + CARROLTON NURSING HOMES | 10 | Split entities |
| Lutheran Services Carolina | LUTHERAN SERVICES CAROLINA + LUTHERAN SERVICES CAROLINAS | 11 | Split entities |

### 6.2 Entity Consolidation

Two entities were split across multiple corporate names and required consolidation:

**Carrolton:**
- CARROLTON FACILTY MANAGEMENT: 4 facilities
- CARROLTON NURSING HOMES: 6 facilities
- **Combined:** 10 facilities

**Lutheran Services Carolina:**
- LUTHERAN SERVICES CAROLINA: 2 facilities
- LUTHERAN SERVICES CAROLINAS: 9 facilities
- **Combined:** 11 facilities

## 7. Revenue Calculation

### 7.1 Fee Structure (From Core Rulebook V19.2)

| Facility Type | Annual Fee per Occupied Bed |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| SNF (Integrated) | $4,583.50 |
| ALF (Integrated) | $3,699.50 |

### 7.2 Revenue Formula

```
Annual Revenue = Census × Fee
```

Where:
- Census = Average daily occupied beds
- Fee = $4,583.50 (SNF) or $3,699.50 (ALF)

### 7.3 Revenue Sources

| Source | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| From Book1_Scoring (original) | 60 | Used as-is |
| Calculated from database | 10 | Missing in workbook |
| **Total** | **70** | |

### 7.4 Calculated Revenue (10 Entities)

| Entity | Integration | New Biz | Total |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Navion | $326K | $0 | $326K |
| ALG | $620K | $0 | $620K |
| Sunrise | $353K | $671K | $1.0M |
| Terra Bella | $261K | $0 | $261K |
| Carrolton | $1.2M | $438K | $1.6M |
| Lutheran Services Carolina | $109K | $670K | $779K |
| Momentous Health | $57K | $0 | $57K |

| Clearview | $490K | $0 | $490K |
| Topaz | $708K | $0 | $708K |

## 8. MUO Criteria Exceptions

### 8.1 Exception Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Meets MUO Criteria (7+ AND Metro) | 56 |
| Exceptions (fails one or both criteria) | 14 |

### 8.2 Exception Categories

**No Metro Presence (12 entities):**
These have 7+ facilities nationally but zero in the 12 priority metros.

| Entity | Tier | National Facilities | Metro Facilities |
|--------|------|---------------------|------------------|
| National Healthcare Corporation | T1 | 65 | 0 |
| Navion | T1 | 18 | 0 |
| Sovereign Healthcare Holdings | T2 | 42 | 0 |
| Heritage Hall | T2 | 16 | 0 |

| Carrolton | T2 | 10 | 0 |
| Seky Holding Co. | T2 | 9 | 0 |
| Yad Healthcare | T2 | 8 | 0 |

**Below 7 Facilities (2 entities):**

| Entity | Tier | National Facilities | Notes |
|--------|------|---------------------|-------|
| Clearview | T2 | 5 | Included for strategic reasons |
| Momentous Health | T2 | 1 | Requires review |

---

## 9. AI/Tech Adoption Gap

### 9.1 Current State

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| AI/Tech Scored (>0) | 12 |
| AI/Tech Not Scored (=0) | 58 |

### 9.2 Decision

**DO NOT apply surrogate (median) values** to unscored AI/Tech Adoption.

Rationale: This dimension requires specific knowledge about each entity's technology posture. Applying median scores would create false precision.

**Impact:** 58 entities receive 0 points from this dimension. Current tier thresholds account for this gap.
